<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbon Steel Rebars Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Deformed Steel</li><li>Mild Steel</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Carbon Steel Rebars Market includes two main types: Deformed Steel Rebars and Mild Steel Rebars. Deformed Steel Rebars are ribbed with patterns to improve concrete adhesion and provide higher tensile strength, making them suitable for heavy construction projects. Mild Steel Rebars, on the other hand, have a smooth surface and lower tensile strength compared to Deformed Steel Rebars. Mild Steel Rebars are commonly used in light construction projects where high tensile strength is not required. Both types of Carbon Steel Rebars are essential components in the construction industry.</p></p>
