<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Marine Monitoring Thermal Imaging System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Un-Cooled Thermal Imaging</li><li>Cryogenically Cooled Thermal Imaging</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Marine monitoring thermal imaging systems use two main types of technology: un-cooled thermal imaging and cryogenically cooled thermal imaging. Un-cooled thermal imaging systems are more common and cost-effective, using infrared detectors that do not require cooling. Cryogenically cooled thermal imaging systems, on the other hand, offer higher resolution and sensitivity but are more expensive and require a cooling mechanism to maintain optimal performance. Both types of systems are used in marine monitoring for various applications such as navigation, security, and search and rescue operations.</p></p>
