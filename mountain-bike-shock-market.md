<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mountain Bike Shock Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air Shock</li><li>Coil Shock</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mountain bike shocks can be categorized into two main types: air shocks and coil shocks. Air shocks use compressed air to provide suspension, allowing for adjustable damping and spring rates. They are generally lighter and more tunable to rider preferences. On the other hand, coil shocks use metal coils to absorb impact and provide suspension. They are known for their durability and consistent performance but may be heavier compared to air shocks. Both shock types cater to different rider preferences and offer unique ride characteristics.</p></p>
