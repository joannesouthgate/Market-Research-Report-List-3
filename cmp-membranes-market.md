<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CMP Membranes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>5-zone, 6-zone and 7-zone</li><li>Below 5-zone (3-zone, etc.)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CMP membranes are classified based on the number of zones they possess, which determine the level of precision and control in polishing processes. The 5-zone, 6-zone, and 7-zone membranes offer varying degrees of control over material removal rates, surface planarity, and defectivity. Meanwhile, below 5-zone membranes such as 3-zone membranes provide less precision and control but are often more cost-effective for certain applications that do not require highly sophisticated polishing capabilities. Each type caters to different needs and preferences within the CMP industry.</p></p>
