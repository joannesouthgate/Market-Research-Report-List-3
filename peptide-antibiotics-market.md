<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Peptide Antibiotics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ribosomal Synthesized Peptide Antibiotics</li><li>Non-Ribosomally Synthesized Peptide Antibiotics</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Peptide antibiotics are classified into two main types: ribosomally synthesized peptide antibiotics and non-ribosomally synthesized peptide antibiotics. Ribosomal synthesized peptide antibiotics are produced by ribosomes in bacterial cells and are typically small molecules with a defined sequence. Non-ribosomally synthesized peptide antibiotics, on the other hand, are synthesized by enzymes outside of ribosomes and are often larger and more complex molecules. Both types of peptide antibiotics have shown promise in treating various bacterial infections.</p></p>
