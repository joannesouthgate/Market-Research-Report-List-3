<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 1-Butene Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Crude C4 Seperation</li><li>Ethylene Dimerization</li></ul></p>
<p><p>1-Butene is primarily produced in two ways - Crude C4 Separation and Ethylene Dimerization. Crude C4 Separation involves isolating 1-Butene from a mixture of C4 hydrocarbons using processes like distillation. On the other hand, Ethylene Dimerization is a more complex process where ethylene molecules are combined to form 1-Butene. Both methods cater to different market demands, with Crude C4 Separation being more common in the petrochemical industry and Ethylene Dimerization offering a more specialized product for specific applications.</p></p>
