<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water-Based Seed Colorants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dyes</li><li>Pigments</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The water-based seed colorants market consists of two main types - dyes and pigments. Dyes are water-soluble colorants that penetrate the seed coat and provide a uniform coloring effect. They are mostly used for coloring smaller seed batches. On the other hand, pigments are insoluble particles that adhere to the seed surface to create a more long-lasting color. They are preferred for coloring larger seed batches due to their durability and resistance to fading. Both dyes and pigments play a crucial role in enhancing the visual appeal of seeds for various purposes.</p></p>
