<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Semiconductor Gas Purifiers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Point of Use Gas Purifiers</li><li>Bulk Gas Purifier</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Semiconductor gas purifiers are used to remove contaminants from gases in semiconductor manufacturing processes. Point of use gas purifiers are small units that are installed directly at the point where gases are used, such as in a gas line leading to a processing tool. Bulk gas purifiers, on the other hand, are larger units that are used to purify gases in bulk before they are distributed to various points of use. Both types of purifiers play a crucial role in ensuring the quality and reliability of semiconductor manufacturing processes.</p></p>
