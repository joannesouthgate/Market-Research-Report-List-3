<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automatic Fiber Placement Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastic Composite Materials</li><li>Thermosetting Composites</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automatic fiber placement machines are used in two main markets: thermoplastic composite materials and thermosetting composites. </p><p>Thermoplastic composite materials are made from polymer resins that become soft and moldable when heated and solidify when cooled, allowing for reshaping and recycling. They are lightweight, have high impact resistance, and are suitable for industries like aerospace and automotive.</p><p>Thermosetting composites, on the other hand, become permanently rigid when heated and cured, offering high strength and stiffness. They are commonly used in applications where high thermal and chemical resistance is required.</p></p>
