<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Centrifugal Industrial Dryers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct</li><li>Indirect</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Centrifugal industrial dryers can be categorized into two main types: direct and indirect dryers. Direct dryers involve the material to be dried coming into direct contact with the hot air or gas, while indirect dryers use a rotating drum that heats the material through conduction. Direct dryers are typically more efficient and faster, as they allow for direct heat transfer, while indirect dryers are often used for materials that are sensitive to high temperatures or require a gentler drying process.</p></p>
