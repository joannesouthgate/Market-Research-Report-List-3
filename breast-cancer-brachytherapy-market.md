<p><strong>The Breast Cancer Brachytherapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High-Dose Rate</li><li>Low-Dose Rate</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Breast Cancer Brachytherapy is a radiation therapy used to treat breast cancer by delivering radiation directly to the tumor site. There are two main types of Breast Cancer Brachytherapy: High-Dose Rate (HDR) and Low-Dose Rate (LDR). HDR delivers a high dose of radiation in a short amount of time, typically through temporary catheters or applicators. LDR, on the other hand, delivers a lower dose of radiation continuously over a longer period, often using permanent implants. Both types have shown effectiveness in treating breast cancer.</p></p>
